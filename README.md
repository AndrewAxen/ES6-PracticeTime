# ES6 - Practice Time

1. Create a class called Person that has a constructor taking two parameters: name and age. The class should have a method called greet() that returns a string with the person’s name and age, like “Hello, my name is [NAME] and I am [NUMBER] years old.” Create an instance of the Person class and call the greet() method on it.
   
2. Create a subclass of Person called Student that has an additional property called major. Add a method to the Student class called study() that returns a string saying “I am studying [SUBJECT].” Create an instance of the Student class and call the greet() and study() methods on it.
  
3. Create an abstract class called Animal that has a constructor taking a name parameter. The class should have an abstract method called speak() that returns a string with the animal’s sound. Create two subclasses of Animal: Dog and Cat. Implement the speak() method for each subclass to return the appropriate sound. Create an instance of each subclass and call the speak() method on them.
